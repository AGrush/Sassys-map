# Title
## Subtitle
### Another deeper title

You can use one `#` all the way up to `######` six for different title sizes.

If you have inline code blocks, you can wrap them in backticks: `var example = true`.

If you've got a longer block of code, you can use ```:

```
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

Bullet list:
* Start a line with an asterisk
* Food
  * Fruits
    * Oranges
    * Apples

Numbered list:
1. One
2. Two
3. Three

A horizontal line looks like this:
---
This is text.

> This is a blockquote.
>
> This is the second paragraph.

It's very easy to make some words *italic* and other words **bold**.
Any word wrapped with two tildes (like ~~this~~) will appear crossed out.

If you want to insert images, this is how you do it:
